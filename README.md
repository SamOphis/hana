# hana (花, 💐)
hana is an experimental programming language implemented in [Scala](https://scala-lang.org),
using the [fastparse](https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/fastparse) library.

It is currently nothing more than a bare-bones parser but will be enhanced and updated with time.
I have no plans to make hana anything more than a learning project at the moment.

# Design Goals
* static types
* functional (insp. by [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org))
* concise (insp. by [Python](https://python.org))
* no `null` or `undefined`
* JVM interop
* more with time
